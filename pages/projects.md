## About some of my projects

### readability-rg

This Python package computes common readability measures on text files. It computes Flesch reading ease, SMOG index, and others. The code is at [github](https://github.com/raygard/readability-rg); also see the [documentation](../../readability-rg/).

### giflzw

I contributed a GIF encoder to the Python Imaging Library (PIL, now Pillow). It was an interesting project, and seems to be working without any issues for a few years now. The project files are at [github](https://github.com/raygard/giflzw); also see the [documentation](../../giflzw/). (This is code for doing the same kind of incremental coding that is in the GifEncode.c module in Pillow, but that module is not included here.)

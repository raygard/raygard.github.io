### About some of my projects

## giflzw

I contributed a GIF encoder to the Python Imaging Library (PIL, now Pillow). It was an interesting project, and seems to be working without any issues for a few years now. The project files are at [github](https://github.com/raygard/giflzw); also see the [documentation here](https://raygard.net/giflzw).
